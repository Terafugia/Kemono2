        <b>June 25, 2021 -</b> Added Fantia support.<br>
        <b>June 13, 2021 -</b> It's been a stressful few days, but we've managed to more or less fix the performance issues with small tweaks to how the site works. Additionally, multiple reliability improvements have been made to the importer. I'm aware Partychan is down, but I don't own/manage the servers and the person who does has not responded to my messages. Regardless, I will try my best to get the board back up and running as soon as possible.<br>
        <b>June 8, 2021 -</b> The Gumroad importer has been patched. The SubscribeStar importer is currently non-functional for unknown reasons; investigations are underway.<br>
